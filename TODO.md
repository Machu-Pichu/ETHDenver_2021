# ETH Denver 2021
Update of 2021-02-12

# The big picture, to be executed after ETH Denver 2021
1. Beyond the buidlathon, we follow our storyboard and continue adding features to Pepito
2. When we something showable that can simply be derived to make a taylored application for a specific NGO, I'd try and enroll a few small NGO's
3. If I succeed, I'll approach the Luxembourg government, as well as the German and French governments, and also the European Institutions for funding and operations
4. When we reach 10'000-50'000 persons in need with these small NGO's, I'll propose to UNICEF, Red Cross, WFP, Oxfam to join
